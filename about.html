            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Matt. I am a senior at Michigan State University studying Information
                Science and Information Technology. Back in high school I took a couple web design
                classes, so I was very excited to take this course. So far, I have found it very
                interesting as it gives a deeper perspective to what really goes into designing
                and developing web pages. This lab in particular was helpful because it required
                me to structure this html file by myself, figuring out the correct typography and
                structure. Below is a picture of me during a soccer game!
            </p>

            <p>Outside of school, I enjoy these things in my free time:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Playing Soccer, Basketball and Golf</li>
                <li>Playing the Guitar</li>
                <li>Working out and staying active</li>
                <li>Playing video games and card games with my roommates</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Thank you for checking out my blog, and I hope you enjoy my posts!</p>

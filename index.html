            <h2>What my IM soccer team needs to do in order to improve</h2>
            <p>This blog post is meant to be for anyone to read, not only those who watch soccer. In soccer, teams play with a certain formation. The names of the formations go by the number of players in each line. For example, a popular formation is the 433. This formation has a defensive line of 4 people, a midfield line of 3 people, and an attacking line of 3 people. In the IM soccer league at MSU, you can only play with 8 outfield players. My team has been playing under a 332 formation, but this does not seem to be working as of recent. The reason behind this is because the some of the midfielders push up too far, leaving the middle of the field exposed and allowing the other team to pass through us. In my opinion, a solution to this would be to run a 323 formation. In this formation, 2 of the 3 attackers would be farther out wide, playing a wing position. The 2 midfielders would sit farther back, a bit in front of the defense line, and play balls out wide to the wingers. The wingers would then be able to run in behind the defense, and either cut in with the ball to shoot, or cross the ball in to the central attacker or opposite winger. If my IM soccer team did this, I believe we would be able to score more goals and win more games.</p>

            <h2>The current situation with European soccer club PSG</h2>
            <p>PSG, also known as Paris Saint-Germain F.C., is a soccer club that plays in the French Ligue 1. They are located in Paris and have been a top club in Europe for some time now. In the past, PSG has had some legendary players play for their club including Ronaldinho, Thiago Silva, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Since 2017, PSG has also had two of the best players in the world, Neymar Jr. and Kylian Mbappe. The two attackers have torn up the French league and the Champions League, but they have not won any significant trophies. This past summer, PSG had one of the best transfer windows ever seen. Every player that they signed is a fantastic player in their position, including the greatest player of all time in my opinion, Lionel Messi. With a starting attacking lineup of Neymar, Mbappe and Messi, along with a solid midfield and defenders in their prime, PSG look to have one of the greatest teams ever on paper. But, in their last domestic league game, their attack managed 0 shots on target throughout the entire game. So why is PSG struggling with such good players? In my opinion, is stems from all three of their big attackers wanting the spotlight. They all want to be seen as the best attacker, so they are really hurting themselves more than they are helping themselves. They also do not have much chemistry yet, having only played with each other for a couple months. I do believe, though, that PSG will be able to figure out their tactics and start winning games more consistently again.</p>
            <p>Here are PSG's results from their last 3 games:</p>
